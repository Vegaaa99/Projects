### About this Repository 

<p>
In this repository, you will find three folders corresponding to projects completed during my college degree.
</p>
- **CARACTERIZACION-COBALTO**: This was a group project where I was in charge of the analysis of the data for the Diffuse Reflectance and Absorbance of a sample of Cobalt. You will find two Jupyter notebooks: one for the reflectance and the other corresponding to the absorbance. In this project, I used Python. For extracting the data, I used the pandas library, and for plotting, I employed the matplotlib library. Two CSV files contain the obtained data from analyzing the sample in a Scanning Electron Microscope. Additionally, there is the final document of the lab report.;
- **Entrelazamiento-SPDC**: This folder corresponds to a group project on quantum entanglement in polarization, where Gabriel (see the authors of the report) and I were responsible for the data analysis. There are two CSV files: one corresponding to the data obtained without the BBO crystal, and the other corresponding to the data with the BBO crystal. Additionally, a Jupyter Notebook is included, where I utilized Python. For data extraction and manipulation, I employed the pandas and NumPy libraries. To visualize the data, I used the Matplotlib library. Finally, there is the comprehensive final document encompassing the entire lab report.;
- **GALI-INDEX**: This folder corresponds to a group project on measuring chaos using the GALI2 index. All the code presented in the Jupyter Notebook is authored by me. Inside this folder, you'll find two CSV files: one containing data for the Milky Way and the other for the Andromeda galaxy. Additionally, there are two Jupyter Notebooks where I utilized the Astropy and pandas libraries for data extraction and employed Matplotlib for data visualization.
